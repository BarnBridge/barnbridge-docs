# How to sell senior bonds?

Senior bonds are ERC-721 NFTs. Therefore, they canâ€™t be traded on regular DEXes. However, users can use NFT markets to sell them, such as OpenSea, Rarible, and others. 

From our side, we are working on the secondary market solution with good UX and UI to provide the best experience for senior bonds swaps.
