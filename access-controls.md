# Access Controls

This protocol can pause deposits into SMART Yield products in case of an emergency. This functionality is controlled by the guardian (5/7 multisig in control of the core team members). The reason why this control is given to guardian multisig vs the DAO is because it takes 7 days for a DAO proposal to pass, which might be too long.
