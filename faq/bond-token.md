## How long is the vesting schedule?

The vesting schedule is designed so that there is not a giant cliff waiting over user’s heads at a specific point. The tokens allocated to the Founders, Seed Investors, and Advisors are locked in a smart contract that releases the tokens on a weekly basis over a two year period. The vesting period started with the launch of the Yield Farming mechanism.

Every $BOND NFT is one of a kind. There may be similar ones in the collection but no 2 are exactly the same.  
  
Downstream, we’ve seen DeFi projects propose using NFTs as proof of liquidity in income streams & wrapped NFTs as loan representations. With almost every high profile DeFi project experimenting in one way or another, the point is clear: DeFi is looking into NFTs. While we’ve been looking at what NFTs mean for DeFi, at the moment, we’re just paying attention.
