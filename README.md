# Get Started with BarnBridge

Hey there!  
  
We are pleased to welcome you on the BarnBridge Docs page. It’s a great place to start learning more about the protocol and its products.

BarnBridge is a risk tokenizing protocol. It aims to reduce the risks associated with DeFi, such as inflation risk, market price risk, and cash-flow volatility risk. By letting users select a risk profile, BarnBridge can redistribute risk via tokenized, liquid tranches. BarnBridge does this with its SMART Yield, SMART Exposure, and SMART Alpha products, all of which address a specific DeFi risk category.

The continued development of the dApps is provided by the core team and governed by the community through the BarnBridge DAO.
