# Multiplier & Voting Power

The voting on the DAO will be performed with the non-tradable vBOND tokens. To get vBOND, you have to stake or lock your $BOND tokens.

Below are described 3 use cases with $BOND and vBOND.

## **1. You can lock $BOND for vBOND.**

* You can lock $BOND for a period of up to 1 year and get bonus vBOND.
* The bonus is linear â€” max 1 year, max 2x multiplier. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Example:   
- lock 1,000 $BOND for 1 year and get 2,000 vBOND  
- lock 1,000 $BOND for 6 months and get 1,500 vBOND  
{% endhint %}

* Bonus has a linear decay relative to locking duration. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Example: lock 1,000 $BOND for 1 year and get 2,000 vBOND at T0  
- after 6 months the balance is 1,500 vBOND  
- after 9 months the balance is 1,250 vBOND
{% endhint %}

* You can lock and the period is the same:
  * base balance is increased with the added BOND
  * multiplier is recalculated relatively to the new lock expiration date
* You can only withdraw your BOND balance after the lock expires.

## **2. You can stake $BOND for vBOND.**

* You can stake $BOND tokens without locking them. No bonus is applied. vBOND balance = $BOND balance.
* You can stake more $BOND and get the same amount of vBOND
* You can redeem your $BOND tokens at any time.

## **3. You can delegate vBONDs to other users**

* There can be only one delegatee at a time.
* Only actual balance can be delegated, not a bonus.
* Delegated balance cannot be locked.
* You can take the delegated vBONDs at any time.
