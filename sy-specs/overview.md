# Overview

SMART Yield allows users to tranche out the yield from the debt pools of other projects, such as Aave, Compound, Cream, or Yearn Finance to normalize the risk curve by creating derivatives for risk mitigation. 

Users are able to buy junior or senior tokens which represent tranches. Junior token holders provide liquidity & buy risk from senior bond investors. The risk here is variable rate annuities going below the expected level. Investors that buy senior bonds will have a guaranteed yield/interest rate for the life of the bond. 

At the same time, juniors will benefit from the extra rewards generated by tokens locked by seniors in cases where the variable APY of the underlying lending protocol \(including the governance token rewards\) are higher than the weighted average guaranteed yields of current seniors. It is expected that the senior positions will have more capital in a pool than the junior ones so the yield may be split by them accordingly.
