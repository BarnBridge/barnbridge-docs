# Junior Tranches \(Tokens\)

## Junior tokens \(jTokens\)

Junior tranches are represented by ERC-20 tokens \(jTokens\) which provide liquidity and buy risk from Senior bond investors. Junior tranches have variable APY and are more risky than senior tranches.

The Juniors will benefit from the extra rewards generated by liquidity locked in sBONDs by Seniors in situations where the variable APY of Compound \(including the COMP rewards\) is higher than the guaranteed yields of current sBONDs. On the other hand, in the event of falling rewards from Compound, the returns of Juniors are diminished and if need be, their locked funds will be used to pay for the guaranteed returns of sBONDs.

In order to provide the best UX for Juniors and encourage them to participate in SMART Yield pools, the system will allow them to join the pool at any time. Moreover, they will have a possibility of instant withdrawal of at least part of their funds, without affecting the integrity of the system and keeping the guarantees.

To do that, we calculate the profits and losses of the pool very efficiently. We do that by averaging all existing sBONDs into one “weighted average” sBOND.

## jTokens APY

Junior APY determines the annual percentage yield for junior tokens at the current time. 

The APY for your junior position is realized when selling your junior tokens for their respective underlying tokens, at whatever the current junior token-to-underlying token price is. The conversion rate of junior tokens starts at 1:1, and slowly grows \(or drops\) when interest accrues. Depending on the annualized difference between your purchase and sell price you can calculate your APY.

Whenever senior positions have to be filled by junior funds \(in the case that the underlying lending protocol offers lower rates than current seniors get\), the price drops.

Otherwise, whenever yield accrues to junior positions that leverage senior funds, the conversion rate increases.

## Junior bonds

The Junior Bonds are represented by ERC-721 non-fungible tokens that have a value denominated in junior tokens, and a maturity date equal to that of the ABOND. These special types of bonds are issued as part of the 2-step withdrawal process.

A junior is subject to Senior tranche risk. In order for a jToken holder to exit the pool, the current sBONDs need to mature. Because it is computationally intensive and gas inefficient to track each and every sBOND with each tx, we opt to use the Aggregated Bond \(ABOND\) as an approximation for the Senior tranche.

### Steps for exit: 

**1st step:**

* recalculate price;
* transfer Junior jTokenDAI \(for example\) to pool \(lock\);
* mint a junior BOND token \(NFT\) and transfer to Junior;
* queue liquidation after ABOND.maturesAt. First tx after that timestamp will trigger the liquidation.

**2nd step:** After the lock period has ended, the Junior can redeem the jBOND NFT and finish the Withdraw process:

* send junior's liquidated DAI;
* burn the jBOND NFT.

The set of features that a senior bond has is:

* tokens - the amount of jTokens deposited in the bond;
* maturesAt - the maturity date at which it can be redeemed.
