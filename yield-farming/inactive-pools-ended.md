# Inactive Pools (Ended)

## USDC/DAI/sUSD Pool

USDC/DAI/sUSD yield farming pool was launched on Oct 19th, 2020. This staking contract was the first mechanism delivering initial $BOND token distribution to the community. This contract held 8% of the total supply and was distributed to community members who staked DAI, USDC, & sUSD.

Stablecoins were equally rewarded. 1 USDC = 1 DAI = 1 sUSD.
