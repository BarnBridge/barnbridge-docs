## USDC/BOND LP Pool&#x20;

USDC/BOND liquidity pool incentivization program was launched on Oct 26th, 2020. The concept behind the initiative is to reward long-term liquidity providers of the Uniswap USDC/BOND pool with progressively more power over the protocol as they continue to signal their belief in the BarnBridge vision.\
\
You have to stake the uniswap v2 LP tokens (USDC\_BOND\_UNI\_LP). Youâ€™ll get them for providing liquidity to the [USDC/BOND pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/v2/0x0391d2021f89dc339f60fff84546ea23e337750f/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48) on Uniswap.
